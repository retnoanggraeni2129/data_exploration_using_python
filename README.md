# This project is a test to solve several problems that were previously carried out several processes as follows:

# Instruction:
1. Data cleaning: before starting the analysis, make sure the data is clean, one of which is the absence of duplicate rows. Duplicate rows have different definitions depending on the case at hand. Define duplicate rows in this case then check if the dataset has duplicate data then answer the questions below.
   - How many invoices have duplicates? Create a list of duplicate invoices
   - Clean the data from duplicate rows by first organizing the data by invoice number (ascending) and customer id (ascending).
2. How many transactions occurred during March? And what is the % increase against last month?
3. Which branch store had the highest rating during the first quarter of 2019?
4. Which branch store has the largest profit?
5. Show 3 customer ids with the largest purchase value for each branch store

# Questions About User Lifetime Value:
1. Calculate the expected shopping frequency for each customer for the next 3 months using the BG-NBD algorithm.
2. Calculate the expected value generated for each customer for the next 3 months using the Gamma-Gamma algorithm
